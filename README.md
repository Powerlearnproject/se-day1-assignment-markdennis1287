#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Software engineering is a systematic approach for designing, developing, testing and maintaining software.
Importance:
1. Enables for creation of software that is reliable and of high quality.
2. Software engineering helps in building applications that are scallable and can adapt to changes.
3. It ensures user satisfaction because software engineering focuses on the users' needs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Rise of Open-Source software (Late 1990s- Early 2000s). The introduction of ope source software such as Linux, Apache and Mozila Firefox demonstrated the power of community driven development, encouraging collaboration, transparency and innovation in software engineering.
2. Afoption of DevOps (2010s). DevOps is the combination of development and operations that help in improving collaboration, automation and continuous delivery of software. It helped in bridging the gap between development and IT operations enhancing the speed and quality of software being developed.
3. Advancements in AI and Machine Learning (2020s). AI and Machine Learning have been imactful in software engineering as it enhances various aspects of software engineering such as generation of code, testing and management of projects. This has further improved accuracy, productivity and decision making in software engineering.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning: This is the scope , budgets and timelines of the project are defined.
2. Requirement Analysis: In this part, the requirements from the users and stakeholders are gotten and analysed in the context of software being developed
3. Design: In this section, the designing of the software is done and an accurate architecture design for the project is made.
4. Implementation: This ia where the actual development happens and the codes required are written.
5. Testing: This phase involves testing the developed software to ensure it works as intended and meets the requirements.
6. Deployment: This is releasing the developed software to produstion environment for use.
7. Maintenance: This phase involves continously updating and improving the software after it was deployed.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Wterfall methodology:
- This is a linear and sequential aproach methodology of developing software.
- Requires a detailed documentation of each phase of the development.
- It has fixed requirements so changes to the requirements are difficult to make once the project has started.
Used where compliance and documentation is critical such as construction or aerospace industries.
2. Agile methodology:
- This is an iterative and incremental approach methodology where work is done in small repeated cycles.
- This is a flexible methodology as it acomodates for changes in the requirements.
- It relies a lot on user feedback during the development process.
Used in projects such as mobile application develoment where requirements can change frequently.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer: The primary role of a software engineer is to build and maintain software applications.
   - Designing software: The are actively involved in designing the architecture of the software to be developed.
   - Writing code: They develop and write code for the sfotware applications following the requirements for it.
   - Testing: They perform tests on the developed software to remove bugs and ensure it works as intended.
   - Collaborating with other team members to ensure the software is developed.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures that the software developed is of high quality and functionality.
   - Planning tests: Develops and excecutes tests and test cases for the project.
   - Performs manual testing to ensure the functionality of the software.
   - Reports bugs found in the testing of the software.
   - Ensures that the quality standards are met and the user requirements are also met
3. Project Manager: They oversee and coordinate the whole process of software development.
   - They are responsible for the planning phase of the project.
   - They allocate resources, assign tasks and manage the other team members.
   - They communicate with the stakeholders and act as a bridge between them and the development team.
   - They monitor the progress of the software development process.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Importance of Intergrated Development Environments(IDEs):
- IDEs have various tools that help in improving the efficiency and productivity in using them.
- IDEs have code completion and syntax highlighting functionalities which help developers to identify and fix errors easily.
- IDEs have tools for code refactoring that helps developers in improving the structure of code without needing to change the functionality of the code.
- IDEs help in intergrated testing as they have testing frameworks that allow developers to write, run and manage tests.
An example of an IDE is Visuo Studio Code (VS Code).
Importance of Version Control Systems(VCS):
- VCSs enable collaboration between developers working on the same project without overwriting each other's code.
- VCSs store history of changes made including who made the change and when. This helps in tracking of the changes made in the project.
- VCSs enable for backup and recovery of projects as all the versions are stored in a centralised repository so if there is an issue developers can recover previous working versions of the project.
- VCSs ensure accountability as each developer is accountable to each chnage they have made to the project.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. User Experience: Building and developing software that is user friendly interface can sometimes be a challenge.
   - Can be overcome by conducting research on users and usability testing and also improving the design based on user feedback.
2. Security concerns: Software engineers need to develop software that is secure and protected from vulnerabilities.
   - Can be overcome by adoptind secure coding guidelines and performing regular security audits and pen testing following the current threats.
3. Balancing performance and functionality: Software engineers need to ensure that software performs properfly and offers proper functionality.
   - This can be overcome by continuously optimizing code to ensure it performs perfectly and efficiently as well as performing performance testing on the software.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing: This involves individual testing of components or units of code.
   - Ensures quality of code is up to standard as it ensures eah component works properly as intended.
   - It enables for early detection of bugs in the software.
2. Intergration Testing: This involves testing the interactions between different components to ensure they are working together properly.
   - It verifies components are proerly intergrated and work together properly.
   - Ensures the system is working together as one whole.
3. System Testing: This involves the complete testing of the intergrated system to ensure it meets the requirements.
   - Ensures all the needs and requirements of the users and stakeholders are met.
   - Ensures the whole system is functional and al the components ad features work seamlessly.
4. Acceptance Testing: This is done by users and stakeholders to ensure that the users' and stakeholders' needs for the software are met.
   - Confirms that the needs and requirements by the users and stakeholders are met.
   - It acts as a final check for the software before it is released for production.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
This is the process of designing and refining input to be given to AI models to get the most accurate and relevant response.
- Ensures clarity and specificity: Provides clear and specified instructions that reduces ambiguity and narrows down the scope of the response to get accurate information from the prompt.
- Efficiency: Properly crafted prompts reduce the time needed to get information from AI as the AI understands the input easily and provides a valid acurate response.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: "Tell me about a car."
Improved prompt: "Can you provide detailed information about the features, safety ratings, and price range of the 2024 Toyota Camry?"
The improved prompt is more effective as compared to the vague one as it has more clear instructions to the AI and also has a narrower scope that will procide an accurate response to the prompt provided.
